View the shape of an execution plan and analyze the plan 
=============================================================================



To view the shape of an execution plan and analyze the plan, perform the following steps:

1. Run the `EXPLAIN` command to view the shape of the execution plan, or view the cached execution plan by real-time execution plan display. For more information, see [Introduction to SQL execution plan](/en-US/12.sql-optimization-guide-1/2.sql-execution-plan-3/1.introduction-to-sql-execution-plans-2.md) and [Real-time execution plan display](/en-US/12.sql-optimization-guide-1/2.sql-execution-plan-3/5.real-time-execution-plan-display-3.md).

   

2. Analyze the execution plan to determine whether your selection of the index, join order, and join algorithm is reasonable and correct. For more information, see [Access path](/en-US/12.sql-optimization-guide-1/4.sql-optimization-1/5.query-optimization-2/1.access-path-3/1.overview-16.md), [Join order](/en-US/12.sql-optimization-guide-1/4.sql-optimization-1/5.query-optimization-2/2.join-algorithm-5/3.join-order-3.md) and [Join algorithms](/en-US/12.sql-optimization-guide-1/4.sql-optimization-1/5.query-optimization-2/2.join-algorithm-5/2.join-algorithm-6.md).

Analyze slow SQL queries 
=============================================



You can analyze a slow SQL query through the following ways:

* View the statistics of the SQL query in the `sql_audit` table and analyze its SQL execution plan.

* Verify whether the execution plan is correct. For more information, see [View the shape of an execution plan and analyze the plan](/en-US/12.sql-optimization-guide-1/4.sql-optimization-1/3.monitor-sql-execution-performance-1/4.sql-performance-analysis-example-1/3.view-and-analyze-the-execution-plan-1.md).

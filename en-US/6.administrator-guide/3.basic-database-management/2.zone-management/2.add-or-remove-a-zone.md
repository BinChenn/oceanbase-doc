Add or delete zones 
========================================

You can add or delete zones by using SQL statements or on OCP. 

Add or delete zones by using SQL statements 
----------------------------------------------------------------

You can add zones to a cluster to scale out the cluster or delete zones from a cluster to scale in the cluster. 

The command for adding or deleting a zone is as follows, where the `Zone_Name` parameter specifies the name of the target zone: 

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM {ADD|DELETE} ZONE Zone_Name;
```



**Example 1** : The following example statement adds `Zone1` to the cluster. 

```sql
obclient> ALTER SYSTEM ADD ZONE Zone1;
```

 **Example 2** : The following example statement deletes `Zone1` from the cluster.



```sql
obclient> ALTER SYSTEM DELETE ZONE Zone1;
```



Add zones on OCP 
-------------------------------------

**Note**

The operation interface of OCP may vary with the version. The following provides the operation guide for OCP V2.5.0. For operations on other OCP versions, see the User Guide of the corresponding version.

You can add zones to a cluster based on the actual deployment mode. 

1. Log on to OCP. 

   The **Cluster Overview** page automatically appears.
   

2. In the **Clusters** area on the **Cluster Overview** page, select the target cluster and click its name.

   

3. In the upper-right corner on the **Overview** page, click **Create Zone** .

   

4. In the dialog box that appears, set the zone information. 

   By default, only one zone is added. You can click **Add** to add more zones. 

   The following table describes the parameters required for setting the zone information. 
   

   |          Parameter          |                                                                                                                                                                    Description                                                                                                                                                                     |

Delete zones on OCP 
----------------------------------------

You can delete zones from a cluster based on the actual deployment mode. 
**Notice**



Different from the STOP ZONE and DELETE ZONE commands, the zone deletion feature on OCP removes all data replicas in the zone and brings all OceanBase nodes in the zone offline.

1. Log on to OCP. 

   The **Cluster Overview** page automatically appears.
   

2. In the **Clusters** section on the **Cluster Overview** page, select the target cluster and click its name.

   

3. In the **Zones** area on the **Overview** page, select the target zone, click the ... icon in the **Actions** column and select **Delete** .

   

4. In the confirmation dialog box that appears, click **Delete** .

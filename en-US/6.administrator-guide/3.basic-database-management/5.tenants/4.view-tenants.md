View tenants 
=================================

You can view the information about tenants by using SQL statements or OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP). 

View tenants by using SQL statements 
---------------------------------------------------------

Log on to the sys tenant of the cluster in OBClient and run the following statement to view the tenant information of the current cluster. 

```sql
obclient> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.gv$tenant;
```



If you are not the sys tenant, you can also execute the following statement to view the tenants in the cluster: 

```sql
obclient> SHOW TENANT;
```

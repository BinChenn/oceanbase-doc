Modify user privileges 
===========================================

This topic describes how to modify privileges for an OceanBase database user. 

Note 
-------------------------

For privilege grants:

* Before you grant privileges to a user, make sure that the user that you have logged on to has the privileges to be granted and the `GRANT OPTION` privilege.

  

* The user to which the privileges are granted needs to reconnect to the OceanBase database for the newly granted privileges to take effect.

  




For privilege revocation:

* The user that you have logged on to must have the privileges to be revoked and the `GRANT OPTION` privilege.

  

* To revoke the `ALL PRIVILEGES` and `GRANT OPTION` privilege, the user that you have logged on to must have the global `GRANT OPTION` privilege or the `UPDATE` and `DELETE` privileges on the table.

  

* Privilege revocation does not extend to other users. For example, if `user1` has granted some privileges to `user2`, when you revoke the privileges of `user1`, the privileges granted by user 1 to `user2` are not revoked.

  




Grant or revoke privileges using SQL statements 
--------------------------------------------------------------------

* MySQL mode

  The user privilege management syntax in MySQL mode is as follows:

  ```sql
  grant_stmt:
      GRANT privilege_type_list ON privilege_level TO user_option_list [WITH GRANT OPTION];
  
  revoke_stmt:
      REVOKE privilege_type_list ON privilege_level FROM user_name_list;
  
  show_grants_stmt:
      SHOW GRANTS [FOR user_name];
  
  privilege_type_list:
      {ALL [PRIVILEGES] | privilege_type [, privilege_type ...]}
  
  privilege_type:
        ALTER
      | CREATE
      | CREATE USER
      | CREATE VIEW
      | DELETE
      | DROP
      | GRANT OPTION
      | INDEX
      | INSERT
      | PROCESS
      | SELECT
      | SHOW DATABASES
      | SHOW VIEW
      | SUPER
      | UPDATE
      | USAGE
  
  privilege_level:
        *
      | *.*
      | database_name.*
      | database_name.table_name
      | table_name
  
  user_option_list:
      user_option [, user_option ...]
  
  user_option:
      user_name [IDENTIFIED BY 'password']
  
  password:
      STR_VALUE
  
  user_name_list:
      user_name [, user_name ...]
  ```

  

  Examples:
  * Grant privileges

    ```sql
    obclient> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO demo WITH GRANT OPTION;
    ```

    
  
  * Revoke privileges

    ```sql
    obclient> REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES, GRANT OPTION FROM 'demo';
    Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.03 sec)
    ```

    
  

  




Modify user privileges in MySQL mode on OCP 
----------------------------------------------------------------

OCP V2.5.0 and later versions support modification of user privileges in MySQL mode. 

**Prerequisites** 

Before you modify user permissions, ensure that:

* The current OCP user has the permission to modify a tenant. For more information about privileges of OCP users, see OCP User Guide of the corresponding version.

  

* The password box of the current OCP user contains the root password of the tenant. For more information about the password box of an OCP user, see OCP User Guide of the corresponding version.

  




**Procedure** 

1. Log on to the OCP console.

   

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Tenants** to go to the Tenant Overview page.

   

3. In the tenant list, select a tenant whose **Tenant Mode** is **MySQL** and click the name of the tenant to go to the **Overview** page.

   

4. In the left-side navigation pane, click **User Management** .

   

5. In the user list, find the user whose privileges are to be modified. In the **Actions** column, click **Modify Privileges** .

6. In the dialog box that appears, modify the global privileges and database privileges. 

   The following table describes the privileges that you can specify in **Global Privileges** and **Database Privileges** . 

   
   

7. Click **Submit** .

Lock and unlock a user 
===========================================

This topic describes how to lock and unlock an OceanBase Database user. 

Lock and unlock a user using SQL statements 
----------------------------------------------------------------

* MySQL mode

  The following are example statements for locking and unlocking a user in MySQL mode:

  
  * Lock a user

    ```sql
    obclient> ALTER USER demo ACCOUNT LOCK;
    Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)
    
    obclient -udemo@demo0_111 -P2881 -h10.10.10.1   -pttt
    obclient: [Warning] Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure.
    ERROR 3118 (HY000): User locked
    ```

    
  

  

  
  * Unlock a user

    ```sql
    obclient> ALTER USER demo ACCOUNT UNLOCK;
    Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)
    
    obclient -udemo@demo0_111 -P2881 -h10.10.10.1   -pttt
    obclient: [Warning] Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure.

Lock and unlock a user on OCP 
--------------------------------------------------

OCP V2.5.0 and later versions support user locking and unlocking in MySQL mode. 

**Prerequisites** 

Before you lock or unlock a user, ensure that:

* The current OCP user has the permission to modify a tenant. For more information about privileges of OCP users, see OCP User Guide of the corresponding version.

  

* The password box of the current OCP user contains the root password of the tenant. For more information about the password box of an OCP user, see OCP User Guide of the corresponding version.

  




**Procedure** 

1. Log on to the OCP console.

   

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Tenants** to go to the Tenant Overview page.

   

3. In the tenant list, select a tenant whose **Tenant Mode** is **MySQL** and click the name of the tenant to go to the **Overview** page.

   

4. In the left-side navigation pane, click **User Management** .

   

5. In the user list, find the target user and set the switch to On or Off in the **Lock** column. 

   **Note**

   

   If the lock switch is set to On, the user is not allowed to log on to the database. Proceed with caution.

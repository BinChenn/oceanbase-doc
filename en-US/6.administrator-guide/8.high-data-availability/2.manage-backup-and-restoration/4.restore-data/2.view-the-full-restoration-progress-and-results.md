View the full restoration progress and results 
===================================================================

This topic describes how to view the full restoration progress and results in database tables or on OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP). 

View the restoration progress and results in database tables 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. After the restoration starts, run the following commands to view the restoration progress:

   * View the restoration progress of the root table

     ```sql
     obclient> SELECT svr_ip,role, is_restore, COUNT(*) FROM __all_root_table as a, (SELECT value FROM __all_restore_info WHERE name='<target tenant name>') AS b WHERE a.tenant_id=b.value GROUP BY role, is_restore, svr_ip ORDER BY svr_ip, is_restore;
     ```

     
   
   * View the restoration progress of the meta table

     ```sql
     obclient> SELECT svr_ip,role, is_restore, COUNT(*) FROM __all_virtual_meta_table AS a, (SELECT value FROM __all_restore_info WHERE name='<target tenant name>') AS b WHERE a.tenant_id=b.value GROUP BY role, is_restore, svr_ip ORDER BY svr_ip, is_restore;
     ```

     

     or

     ```sql
     obclient> SELECT svr_ip, is_restore, COUNT(*) FROM __all_virtual_partition_store_info WHERE tenant_id=<target tenant ID> GROUP BY svr_ip,is_restore ORDER BY svr_ip, is_restore;
     ```

     

     In the view:
     * `is_restore` indicates the restoration status of a partition. When the value is `0`, the data in the partition has been restored.

       
     
     * `role` indicates the role of the restored replica:

       * 1: indicates a leader.

         
       
       * 2: indicates a follower.

         
       
       * 3: indicates a leader in restoration.

         
       

       
     

     
   

   

2. After the restoration is completed, run the following commands to view the restoration results and history:

   * View the restoration results

     ```sql
     obclient> SELECT * FROM __all_restore_info;
     ```

     
   
   * View the restoration history

     ```sql
     obclient> SELECT * FROM __all_restore_history;
     ```

     
   

   




View the restoration progress and results on OCP 
---------------------------------------------------------------------

To view the restoration progress and results on OCP, perform the following operations: 
**Note**

1. Log on to OCP.

   

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Backup and Recovery** \> **Recovery** .

   

3. On the **Recovery Task** tab, view the progress and results of the restoration task. 

   The tab displays information such as **ID** **,** **Cluster Backup** **,** **Backup Method** **,** **Target Cluster** **,** **Target Tenant** **,** **Recovery Time** , **Storage Directory** **,** **Start Time** **,** **End Time** **,** and **Status** . 

   If the restoration task fails, you can click **View Cause** in the **Actions** column to view the cause of the failure. 

   You can filter restoration tasks by setting the time range in the upper-right corner, for example, **Last 24 Hours** **,** **Last 7 Days** **,** **Last 30 Days** , or **Custom** .
